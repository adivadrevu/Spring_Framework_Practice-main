# Spring Framework

## Key Concepts

- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: A software design principle that gives control of an application flow to an external source (SPRING) rather than the application code.

- **Target Class**: A class that uses other class services/methods or business logic is called the Target class.

- **Dependency Object**: Services used inside the Target class are called Dependency Objects.

- **Dependency Injection**: Injecting Dependent Objects into the Target class.

- **Setter Injection**: Injecting an object into the Target class using the setter method is called Setter Injection.

- **Constructor Injection**: Injecting an object into the Target class using a constructor is called Constructor Injection.
